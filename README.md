# Nix Playground

This repository contains samples of various ways to do things with nix.

They may display anti-patterns or other bad behaviours, feel free to pull
request and explain why I'm wrong.


The reason for this repositories existence is that these would otherwise be
scattered about my file system, with little to no documentation.
